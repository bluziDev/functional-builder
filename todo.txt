-fix: canvas is moved by the toolbar
-make lines snap  to one another when they are moved
-implement selection menu:
    -move
    -delete
    -etc
-relative property editing:
    -buttons for changing angles between lines
    -etc
    -note: you can 
    organize lines into groups, and choose to select
    the group before editing a relative property,
    in which case all the lines in the group will
    use the origin of the property(intersection point
    in the case of a relative angle change)
