-put line input boxes in a div with each other
-figure out what happens when you start drawing a 
    line, press "a" but leave the field empty,
    then finish the line
-input fields for precise line drawing:
    -accessed with shortcut that corresponds
    to property (key "a" for precise angle,
    "l" for precise length, etc)
-make lines snap  to one another when they are moved
-implement selection menu:
    -move
    -delete
    -etc
-relative property editing:
    -buttons for changing angles between lines
    -etc
    -note: lines don't store relationships, so 
    there is no option to "parent", but you can 
    organize lines into groups, and choose to select
    the group before editing a relative property,
    in which case all the lines in the group will
    use the origin of the property(intersection point
    in the case of a relative angle change)
